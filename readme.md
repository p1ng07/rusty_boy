# Info

- Does not emulate bootrom, and will not run alternative bootroms.
- Therefore, Gameboy Color palettes cannot be chosen during run time, maybe I will add them via a color chooser in the application

# TODO

1. Resolve todos
2. Prettify the readme and code
3. Maybe deploy to wasm and have a github pages site for it
4. Release
5. Go night night
