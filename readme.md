# Info

- Does not emulate bootrom, and will not run alternative bootroms.
- Therefore, Gameboy Color palettes cannot be chosen during run time, maybe I will add them via a color chooser in the application

# TODO

1. Better 2x 4x 16x speed
2. Look for visual bugs and correct them
3. Resolve todos
4. Prettify the readme,code and egui application
5. Maybe deploy to wasm and have a github pages site for it
6. Release
7. Go night night
